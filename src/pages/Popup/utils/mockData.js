  summary:
    '(Slack alleges that the world’s largest software firm is up to its old tricks by bundling its dominant package of online productivity tools, Office 365, with a service competing with Slack’s.) Legislators—the members of the antitrust subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives, to be precise—will also put pointed questions to the tech bosses.\n(Then again, if lawmakers manage to make clever use of screen sharing, they could confront the executives with some enlightening charts, such as how much the market capitalisation of the four companies has grown during the pandemic; they are now worth a total of $4.85trn.) What is more, in contrast to smoking and despite years of debate, the harms of remedies for the tech giants’ dominance are not obvious.',
